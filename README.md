# kata-tdd-1 project by Dat Hoang
## This is my very first project with TDD

### The main idea is that:
* Write/update the test follow the requirements and enough to fail the test.
* Update the app enough to pass the test.
* Loop these 2 steps until all the requirements are done.

### I use the clover plugin:
* To check the unit test everytime we build
* I set the test coverate is 100%, it means all the things we have must be covered by unit test
* It will generate for us the report as HTML, XML, PDF ... I choose HTML
